        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A volcano is a location where magma,or hot melted rock from within a planet,reaches the surface. It may happen violently, in a massive supersonic explosion, or more quietly,as a sticky, slow lava flow.</p>
        <p>Volcanoes have been a part of earth's history long before humans. Compare the history of human beings, a few million years in making,to that of Earth,over four<i>billion</i>years in making.</p>
